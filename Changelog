0.4.4
  - No longer display all found class/module documentation found. If core
  documentation is available, output only that, otherwise falls back to gem
  documentation. To show all found documentation use the --all command line
  paramter.

  multi row items more readable, they waste a lot of space for lists 
  containing only single row items. The blank line will be reintroduced for
  lists containing multi row elements later on.

0.4.3
  - If multiple documentations are found that are all class documentations,
