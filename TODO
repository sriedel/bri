- Extend unqualified search to include class methods and case insensitive searches
- {multi word label}[links] won't display correctly if the label is right where
  a line wrap occurs
- Refactor the convoluted rendering of lists and list items
- Detect ansi capabilities and use what is possible with graceful degradation?
- Potentially try to detect method references in documentation prose and 
  highlight these (e.g. Object#send and Object.new)
- Add display of in_files
- Add display of module constant aliases
- Rewrite the search code into something understandable and maintainable
  (sleep deprivation is one hell of a drug)
